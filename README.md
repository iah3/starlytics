# Starlytics: Starcraft II Action and Winner Prediction using a Web App

Replays available at:
```
https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto
https://github.com/wuhuikai/MSC
```

Pre-requisites:
1. Python 3

To install the required libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the app:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

The website can be viewed by going to any of the following:
1. http://127.0.0.1:8000
2. http://localhost:8000

## UI:
- The slider represents current frame number allowing the user to select a different frame.
- "Load Time" loads the frame.
- "Reset" defaults to the first frame of the first file and displays its output.
- "Load File" selects the file number displayed and displays its output.
- "Upload" uploads the selected Global Feature Vector and Spatial Feature Tensor and displays its output.
- An invalid input (i.e. 1 > filenumber > 16) and pressing the load button will be thresholded to this constraint and not generate an error.

## The app provides two options to select the file. 
1. The user can select one of the 16 replays in the subsidized dataset
2. Upload a replay (Spatial Feature Tensor and Global Feature Vector) as desired. 

The app will then use the corresponding input to generate a prediction, actual result of the match using just the current frame. A slider is included which allows the user to go back and forth in terms of the current frame and use a different frame in the replay to generate the image and predictions.

The app uses a django frontend with scikit-learn in the backend. The time instance and the input file or file selected is used to generate the image using matplotlib and prediction using the pre-trained random forest model.

The folder classsifiers contain classifier implementations including training and evaluation.
Folder structure:
	classifiers/
		GlobalFeatureVector/ (obtain from https://github.com/wuhuikai/MSC)
			Protoss_vs_Protoss/
				Protoss/
					<replay_files>
			Protoss_vs_Terran
			Protoss_vs_Zerg
			Terran_vs_Terran
			Terran_vs_Zerg
			Zerg_vs_Zerg
		to_train/
			run_classifiers_auto.py
			<matchup>.csv
			<matchup>_frame<#frame>.csv
		parsing.py
		readme

This program does not take duplicates into account. Before creating files with the scripts, make sure the filename is available. There are two scripts to use to get the classifiers. The entire dataset is not available here, only 'Protoss_vs_Protoss' can be used. To extract the vectors that hold the information for a given frame (minerals, vespene, army count, etc..), use 'parsing.py'. Once this pre-processing is done, use 'run_classifiers_auto.py' to test and get the best classifiers for a given matchup.

- parsing.py
	line 14	: Select the matchup you want to get the info out of 
		(only 'PvP' is available here, if you would like, contact us to get the rest of the data)
	line 50	: Modify the list to change the frames being analyzed. 	
	The output of 'parsing.py' will be the '<matchup>_frame<#frame>.csv' files, in the main/to_train/ folder.

- run_classifiers_auto.py
	line 18 : Change the value to the desired matchup (All matchups are available here)

	'run_classifiers_auto.py' will use the '<matchup>_frame<#frame>.csv' files as input and ouput <matchup>.csv

- <matchup>.csv
	1st line : Type of classifier
	n-th line : n-th value of frame in frame's list


This folder contains a random forest that works for all time instances. The files need to be copied into their parent directory to have the correct path. check_accuracy will evaluate the model training it on 1000 files of the training dataset and testing it on the entire dataset depending on the competition specified. All the files here use the test_train split json files specified in the msc dataset so the entire dataset (Global Feature Vectors) needs to be downloaded and added to path before this can be run.
